## **Project Overview**

This travel budgeting app project aims to help you hone your development skills by building a functional and interactive travel application. The project mainly leverages the ApyHub APIs, providing you an opportunity to learn how to integrate and use APIs effectively.

We use a modern tech stack comprising of TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. This provides an ideal learning platform for understanding how these technologies can be used together to build robust and scalable applications.
